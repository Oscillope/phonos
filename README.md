### phonos

A hardware Sonos controller which harkens back to a simpler time.

# Configuration

In order for this to work, you need a file called `config.py` in the same directory as phonos. It should have an array called `uris` in it, which contains a list of up to 9 Sonos URIs (stations, songs, albums, whatever). See the [SoCo documentation](http://docs.python-soco.com/en/latest/index.html) for more details about URIs.

More configuration bits may be added in the future.
